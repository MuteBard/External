# Notes Manager (External)

## What is this?

    This is an application to help me manage my Game Development notes in these directories:

    unity
    blender

    Having well managed notes is important form me so succeed in my journey to become a well rounded game developer

## What does it do?

    In context of this application, unity and blender are known as platforms. 
    Creating projects within those creates whats called an epic.
    Wanting to do something within an epic such as creating new files or managing readmes (for note taking) is called a task. 
    Doing something within a task like deleting, adding, or failing is called an action. 
    This is to save me from making errors and to save me time in creating and managing projects.
